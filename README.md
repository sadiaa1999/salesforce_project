## Task 2:

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites,books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
  I got my first exposure of working with Javascript through this project. 
  Picking up Javascript wasnâ€™t as hard as I thought since I had previous 
  programming experience in Python and Java. The most challenging part of 
  this project was implementing the feature where the users have 3 tries 
  in the game. The visual logic given on the instruction was very helpful 
  for me to understand the feature. Once I understood the logic, coding up 
  the logic was pretty straightforward at that point. 
  So, I broke down the problem into smaller chunks. I had a variable 
  to keep track of the tries. First, I checked if the first guess is correct, if not I decemented the value by 1. When the user makes correct, I added more logics to see if the user is keep making correct choices and when the number of correct guesses is equal to the length of the array of the pattern of the tiles, I could conclude that the user won the game. I also console logged the values in every step of these conditionals to make sure that my logic was sound.
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  Through this project, I got exposure to working with Javascript and 
  got to learn how different components in Javascript interact with 
  each other in the front end. This experience made me more interested 
  in web development. Now that, I have learned some basics of Javascript,
  I would love to probably pick a more robust Javascript framework 
  like React.js to build more faster, scalable and simple front end apps. 
  Even though I enjoy building UI components in the front-end, 
  I would love to learn more about full stack development for example 
  how backend and front end communicate with each other, connects to a 
  database, authenticate users, etc. In simple worlds, I am more eager 
  to learn about full stack development.
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  If I had more hours to work on this project, I would have loved to finish up the all the optional features. I would implement the timer because I think that would make the game more interesting and add more level of difficulties to the users to play the game. I could add a plus and minus button so that the users could change the timer.
I would also try to make the UI more visually appealing. With more time, I would have also added a button that users could toggle to change the theme of the game. For example, make the UI change from normal mode to dark mode or vice versa.
